# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

#WILL HOLD ALL OUR DATA - WILL BE ACCESSING FROM OUR REACT APPLICATION
#CONTROLLING THOSE INTERACTIONS IN OUR CONTROLLER
#ROUTES NEED TO BE SET UP - FOR WHEN WE MAKE OUR FETCH REQUEST TO GET DATA FROM OUR FRONT END
